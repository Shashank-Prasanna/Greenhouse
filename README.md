# AutoGreen
## Written by SpyGuy

### This is the code for AutoGreen, the Automated Greenhouse. 

##### This code is not perfect! It is open-source, so feel free to edit it and submit a PR, as well as bring any issues to my attention!

#### Commands:
- `/water` : Test water by calling `pumpWater()`
- `/sendData` : Sends data by calling `readSensors()` and `writeData()`
